				<h3 class="title">Confessions of a Hopeless Romantic: Part 1.</h3>
				<p>
					Its funny, in a world where most things are defined by singularity, I as a person seem to have these two halves what fight and contradict each other on a regular basis. Boys. Boys boys boys. Oh where would we be if it weren’t for the boys (feminists humour me). When it comes to boys half of me is like WHY AM I SO ALONE SOMEONE LOVE ME and the other half is like boys… JHEEZE I’m a strong young independent woman I don’t need no man. And yes these two halves aren’t always in balance but hey ho no one’s perfect right? And I definitely feel like this ‘two halves of me’ idea ties into most things that surround the male species. I’ll explain later on.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think its fair to say I’ve had my fair share of dealings with men, the majority good but some bad and a few mind scrambling, excruciatingly, confusingly baffling; and its such a shame because its usually 
					the relationships that may not have been so sweet which define the way we look and approach future ‘potential’. Why don’t we celebrate the good, albeit in the past? Confession: I am totally guilty of only remembering the bad things and I’m awful at taking my own advice…
				</p>
				
				<p>ANYWAY</p>
				
				<p>
					I’ve actually been drafting this post for a couple of weeks now, thinking I’m almost done then deleting it all because I can’t figure out what the right approach is. And I’m not saying that this post will relate to everyone I’m just ready to get another post out there. So the focus of this post is going to be around dating and essentially ‘getting the guy’.
					Can I just ask one question to the world: is it just me that finds dating or seeing someone one of the most complicated and overthought things in the entire universe. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I don’t know if it’s just because I’m opinionated and *admittedly* stubborn but just ERGH. If you’re talking to someone and you like them and they like you, why can’t that be okay? If it’s gone so far as like proper dating and seeing someone WHY CAN’T THAT BE OKAY. Why does it have to get complicated?! At least with me, it always seems to and maybe I’m just unlucky but yeah… not making myself sound very desirable over here.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Maybe it’s because I over-think things, or get too attached, or lay all my cards on the table too soon. But what I don’t understand is why that is a problem. Why is it so hard to expect to be taken out on a date instead of ruddy ‘Netflix and chill’ which we all know the true meaning of. Is that what it’s come to nowadays… straight to bed before you even really know someone.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So now for the advice bit. If you meet a guy and you like him and *you think* he likes you back then BE YOURSELF which seems to be the overriding theme in most of my posts; sorry if it’s repetitive. But yeah just be yourself. Even in the situation where you might think he may not be sure of you and you try to make yourself seem more desirable by doing things you may not normally do… DON’T! because then you’re stuck in the situation of he likes a person that isn’t who you truly are and what’s the good in that?! If you’re like me and its safe to say you’re a little bit crazy then be like that! Don’t tone any aspect of yourself down for anyone.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I can distinctly remember being younger and reading those “How to Tell if He’s Into You” quizzes in magazines like Cosmopolitan and if I could tell my younger self one thing… it would be that those quizzes do nothing but implant more unrealistic thoughts into your already over-thinking brain. Sometimes it’s really hard to take a step back and differentiate between a person acting as who they are and a person acting how you think they would act. Your thoughts can play nasty tricks on you. Example, you see the guy you like kiss another girl in front of you. One half of you is going absolutely ape and thinking HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO ME he’s only doing it because he knows I’m here and he’s trying to make me jealous and I should definitely make him jealous back by kissing another guy in plain sight because that will definitely and blatantly show him that I’m interested. And then theres the other half of you (the rational side) which says well maybe he’s a little bit drunk and he’s being a boy and not thinking and maybe he doesn’t even know I like him, which I think is rational thinking… others may dispute this. Can you see what’s wrong with this? There are far too many different tiny factors to write out because otherwise this will turn into a dissertation as opposed to a blog post but over-thinking things is really really dangerous *guilty as charged*
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In terms of me… I think that one of my biggest weaknesses when it comes to the dating game is that I am a hopeless romantic and I do look at someone I like with heavily rose tinted glasses. I have a tendency to become really attached really quickly and maybe that’s because I’m a passionate person which most would think is a good thing, but I think when it comes to twenty-something guys… yeah not always the best playing card. And in all seriousness who listens to their own advice! But I’ve have definitely been working on being myself whilst taking a step back. So far I think it’s working.
