				<h3 class="title">Mirror Mirror on the Wall... Why Am I So Fat... Or Am I Even Fat At All?</h3>
				<p>I have been told numerous times in the past that “beauty comes from the inside” and I’m a firm believer in this. If you have a poisonous inside it is more than likely to spread and infect all aspects of your life. But sometimes it just doesn’t seem that simple. I simply find it hard to believe that when I look in the mirror and I’m feeling like Quasimodo that I am ‘beautiful’ inside.
				<br>
				<br>
				I know that sounds bitter but I know that I can’t be the only person who feels this way. And this is kind of why I haven’t posted anything in nearly three weeks. I haven’t really been feeling great about myself and I’m only just starting to hold my head a bit higher.
				<br>
				<br>
				Anyway back on topic… Anyone who knows me well knows that I struggle with the way that I look at my body, and my family have most definitely bared the brunt of this personal battle (sorry guys). I 
				have always viewed myself on the more negative end of the scale even if I’m having a good day and to be honest I think I always will. It’s just who I am. But there’s no denying that I have some days where I wake up and feel literally like the world’s most gorgeous creature on the planet and that everyone needs to stare in awe at me. Yes those days are few and far between but it’s kind of nice when you just roll out of bed and you look in the mirror and think “sweet baby Jesus I LOOK DAMN AMAZING”. 
				<br>
				<br>
				One of the biggest struggles with my self-perception is motivation. Why should I go to the gym which makes me tired and eat horrible rabbit food if it’s not going to change anything quickly. I want to be a size 6 and I want that now… as in tomorrow. I can so distinctly remember being 16-17 and thinking that if I lost weight my entire body shape would change to be more like a flat toned rectangle as opposed to a dumpy pear. But that’s not the case. I have finally accepted the fact that I will always be curvy however it is my choice whether I’m a toned pear or a wobbly pear.
				<br>
				<br>
				Since coming to university the biggest lesson that I have learned is that if I want to change the way that I think of myself when I look in the mirror then that means I have to get off my butt and make a change. And to stick to that change. I have to be strict.
				Let’s just say I’m not one for will power so I’ve had to learn to be really strict with myself and most of the time it worst but I do like to cut myself a little slack. It’s important to learn when to treat yourself and how to treat yourself. If you’re trying to cut out junk food it’s probably not wise to have a donut. Or if you’re aiming to go to the gym everyday then having a day in bed doing nothing is not the way to give yourself a reward. It’s healthier physically and mentally to do something positive for your body compared with something toxic.
				<br>
				<br>
				It’s important to remember you aren’t going to have a perfect day every day. You can’t always believe in yourself all the time and that’s perfectly normal but its key to remember that building on your self-doubt will only make you come out stronger. Working on a positive view of yourself is and always will be a working progress so utilize those around you to help motivate you to make changes. Like I said, if you want to make a change then actually make a change. Just sitting and wallowing in self-pity and self-hatred isn’t going to help anyone and especially not yourself.
				<br>
				<br>
				Remember to hold your head up high. We are all human and to be human is to have flaws. It’s how you act on those flaws that is important.
