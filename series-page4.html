					<h3 class="title">Dealing With That Dark Cloud</h3>
					<p>We’ve all experienced that dark cloud. The feeling of bleak emptiness that consumes every aspect of our lives. It feels so intense, but leaves you feeling nothing. What do you do when you get into this state of mind? How do you support someone you know with depression? These are the questions I’ll attempt to answer.</p>

					<h3 class="title">Confidence is Key</h3>
					<p>Now, those of you who know me well will know that I’m a confident person. Never afraid to speak my mind (despite this not always being the wisest of things…) and always able to do well socially. Some of you might think I’m a bit over confident sometimes, and I probably am… but who’s perfect right?</p>

					<h3 class="title">Friendships, Maintenence and Compromise</h3>
					<p>If you’re going to a new school or university and you don’t know anyone, it can be really nerve-racking. I’m going to focus this post more towards university students simply because going to university is slightly different than going to a new school and I’ll write a post about new schools another time..</p>

					<h3 class="title">MIrror Mirror on the Wall... Why am I so Fat... Or am I Even Fat At All?</h3>
					<p>I have been told numerous times in the past that “beauty comes from the inside” and I’m a firm believer in this. If you have a poisonous inside it is more than likely to spread and infect all aspects of your life. But sometimes it just doesn’t seem that simple. I simply find it hard to believe that when I look in the mirror and I’m feeling like Quasimodo that I am ‘beautiful’ inside.</p>
