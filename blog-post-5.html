				<h3 class="title">Dealing With That Dark Cloud</h3>
				<p>
					We’ve all experienced that dark cloud. The feeling of bleak emptiness that consumes every aspect of our lives. It feels so intense, but leaves you feeling nothing. What do you do when you get into this state of mind? How do you support someone you know with depression? These are the questions I’ll attempt to answer. I use the term depression loosely. I was never diagnosed with depression… I was never given that label… I was never prescribed medication. But I did experience all the symptoms of a mildly depressive episode and this is why I use the term depression loosely. It’s important to distinguish the severity of a depression episode so here is the NHS page on depression. Have a read! It’s full of useful information, and if you think you need to see a doctor, please please do!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I can’t really pin point when it started… but I know it started around half way through high school. I remember feeling helpless to my emotions. On the outside, I was bright and bubbly but on the inside I had no confidence and low self-esteem. Even though I didn’t show it, I was battling an inner turmoil of doubt, guilt, and an anxiousness that ruled over everything. I struggled to sleep, even though I have all my life and I still do now, back then my sleep was at it’s worst. I was plagued with anxiety dreams, I would wake in the night petrified of something I couldn’t define. I found it hard to get to sleep, to stay asleep, and so I was constantly tired. I plied myself with sugar and caffeine and as a result I gained a bit of weight. Not a lot, but to me the gain was massive. I started to hate my body, which plunged my self-esteem even lower. I constantly felt sluggish, like there was this dark black sludge inside making everything seem slow. There was a constant feeling of nervousness that I couldn’t do things, so I wouldn’t try. I had all these intense feelings and emotions but it felt like an overwhelming nothingness. 
				I lived this every day.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So in answer to my first question, what do you do when you get into this state of mind? I lived with it. I lived like this until I couldn’t take it any more. I was tired of being tired. I was tired of hating myself. I was fed up with feeling nothing. So I went to a therapist. I changed the way that I looked at myself, at what I felt, understood where those feelings came from and how to manage them if they come back again. And now, I guess you could say I’ve come out the other end. Yes, there are days when I feel like this. But that’s okay. I’ve said this in previous posts… you really can’t be happy all the time. I don’t beat myself up when I get down. The difference is I know how to manage myself when I do. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					There are lots of things you can do to help yourself. Exercise is important, as not only are you making your body healthy, but there is a direct link between exercise and mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, the neurotransmitter related to happy feelings, so exercising will make your brain feel happy. It is the last thing you want to do when you feel like nothing, but even the simplest of things like going for a long walk, will release endorphins. Anyone who knows me well knows that I like to exercise. I strive to exercise for at least an hour at the minimum of three times a week and I really do notice a difference. 
					Another important way to help yourself is to talk. Talk to someone! The main reason I started this blog is to show people that they aren’t alone. I remember feeling totally alone, and I know I would have benefitted from knowing that I wasn’t the only one. Always talk to someone that you trust. A friend, family member, teacher. All of the people in your life are there to support you, so utilise this!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Leading on from this point, how do you support someone you know with depression? If you know someone who is suffering from depression. Just be there for them. It is one of the loneliest places in the world. I found this fantastic article on Facebook from an online magazine called Dazed, titled “how to be a good friend to someone with depression”. It’s a fantastic read, and I totally agree with everything they wrote, so if you want to check it out click here. When you’re listening to someone with depression, and I know this from experience, but sometimes that person doesn’t want advice or your opinion. They just want to let it out. It’s important to understand how to listen and hold your tongue.
					The biggest thing is to speak to someone… and if you’re unsure of who to turn to in your immediate circles, go and speak to your doctor. If it’s a case of not wanting to speak in person, please feel free to email me! I know that it’s hard to seek help when you feel so helpless, but trust me when I say you can recover. You can feel good. That dark cloud will go away.
