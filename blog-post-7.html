				<h3 class="title">Friendships, Maintenence and Compromise</h3>
				<p>
					So I thought that this would be a good first post for me seeing as the start of uni and school is looming, I can remember that I internally struggled with friendships because of who I am as a person.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If you’re going to a new school or university and you don’t know anyone, it can be really nerve-racking. I’m going to focus this post more towards university students simply because going to university is slightly different than going to a new school and I’ll write a post about new schools another time...
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So, you received your A-Level results and you’re off to a new city and you may or may not know anyone, and you’re terrified. I can remember the night before I left for Leeds I dreamt that all my flatmates were really horrible and started a hate group/cult type thing towards me and everyone in my halls joined in I hated every second of it… definitely didn’t catastrophise the situation at all...
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Moving swiftly on and on a slight side note, I’ve been complimented by friends of mine that I’m confident and loud which is always nice to hear (thanks guys love you all so much) but I actually find it quite stressful meeting new people. I’m a great advocate for not letting what people think of you influence how you think of yourself, but honest truth I do find it nerve racking when I’m meeting new people and making new friends. Like, what do they think of me? Am I being too loud? Do they like me? Am I coming across as cocky, arrogant? The list goes on and on.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You can’t simply ‘make people like you’. Unfortunate, yes… but that’s the way the cookie crumbles. However here is what I have learned from meeting new people at university.
				</p>
				
				<p>1. Everyone is in the same boat.</p>
				
				<p>
					It’s kind of weird… you turn up to your new halls and you are thrown into this place you’re supposed to live in for the next year with people you don’t know. My main tip is to be open minded. You may be really lucky and absolutely love all of your flatmates and you all end up getting on really well or, you don’t really like any of them and where does that leave you?
				</p>
				
				<p>2. Try to have various different friendship circles.</p>
				
				<p>
					Your flatmates may not be on the same course as you, so its important to make friends on your course. This will help you MASSIVELY when it comes to crunch time with exams an assignments! I also highly recommend joining a sports team or a society; and so in doing this, you’ll meet various different people from within different parts of your university.
				</p>
				
				<p>3. People come from all walks of life.</p>
				
				<p>
					Again, its important to be open minded when making friends at university. This is a perfect opportunity to meet people who aren’t like you at all which can be a really enriching experience however, also tricky, and this is where compromise comes into play. The biggest thing that I have found is that friendships, new and old, are essentially about balance; balancing each other as well as balancing within yourself, and what I mean by this is learning the parts of you which are your biggest asset in that particular friendship with that particular person which makes the friendship ‘work’.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I’m concious that this post is getting rather long, and I don’t want to ramble!! So quickly, I’m going to touch on maintenance.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You meet someone you really like, they ‘tick all the boxes’ for you and you think that they have the potential to be a long time friend. Its really important to remember once you’ve become friends with someone the process has only just begun because friendships are fluid. You can’t just think “brilliant, I’ve made a friend and thats it”. Friendships take work and I know that sounds laborious and negative but it’s as simple as asking to meet up or go out to your favourite club or have lunch or just something! Loosing touch with a friend doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t friends with them anymore, but its all about contact.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I’m not sure if I’ve put across what I’m trying to say very well, but please comment below with any questions! And if you are going off to university soon, I wish you the best of luck and remember, it’s a whole new adventure so enjoy it!
