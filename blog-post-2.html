				<h3 class="title">Confessions of a Hopeless Romantic: Part 2.</h3>
				<p>What’s the deal with Valentine’s Day? I mean seriously. Sorry for the impending rant but the past few years I have had the highest expectations of gifts and flowers and chocolates and been disappointed… watching other couples go out for romantic dinners and giving each other nice gifts and I’m just sat here like HELLO WHERE MY MAN AT. BUY ME THINGS. This got me thinking… why do I think like this? Is this really necessary? Well I’ve had a couple of realisations, which have changed the way I think.
				<br>
				<br>
				1. Valentine’s Day is a Christian celebration of the martyr and Saint Valentine, celebrated for marrying those who were banned from being married by the Christian church. I think. As someone who is not particularly religious, and especially as someone who has little to no knowledge of the Christian faith, researching this proved confusing and difficult. However, from what I’ve read, Valentine’s Day actually did not have any connection to love until the 14th century, and it is only in more modern times that the celebration has become massively commercialised. So why buy into it?
				<br>
				<br>
				2. If you are in a relationship, why would you treat the person you are with in an extra special way on just one day of the year? NO NO NO. Sorry I just really don’t agree with this. If you’re in a relationship you should strive EVERYDAY to make your significant other feel special. Now this doesn’t necessarily mean showering that person in gifts and dinners and expensive things constantly… nobody has got time for that, but you should do your best to try and make that person as happy as they can be every day. Isn’t that what being in a relationship is about?
				<br>
				<br>
				3. I feel like there’s an assumption that being single on Valentine’s Day is a negative thing, which calls for copious amounts of junk food and alcohol to ‘make me feel better about myself’. Just as I said in the previous point, you should show love everyday regardless, and I think that this is transferable to the self. Show yourself more love every day and constantly strive to find happiness in every day.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sorry if this post seems a bit cynical… I’m not a grumpy old woman shaking my finger at commercialism. However, I do strongly think that people take Valentine’s Day far too seriously and lose sight of what it means to be in a relationship around this time of the year. My secret trick is to not expect anything. If you never expect anything you are never disappointed and always surprised. Try and see this through the Valentine’s Day fog. 
				<br>
				<br>
				And for fellow singletons out there… YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I know the feeling of “I’m always the girl before the girlfriend” and “I’m going to be single forever” and Valentine’s Day always seems to amplify that feeling in me but you have you realise that this is not true! It’s shitty to hear but what is meant to be will happen, whether it’s now or 5 years down the line… When it comes to relationships, being patient is the hardest lesson. If you’re struggling to find something to do, always know that you don’t have to do buy into anything just to fit in. Do WHATEVER you want. If it is to drown yourself in alcohol, then that’s fine! If it’s to act like it’s no different from any other day then that’s fine too!! Remember to love yourself regardless of your relationship status. 
				<br>
				<br>
				This is my 10th post! I’d just like to say a massive thank you for all your support. I will do a Confessions Of A Hopeless Romantic: Part 3. soon, so keep your eyes peeled. Anything in particular you want me to discuss? Feel free to comment or email me privately!
