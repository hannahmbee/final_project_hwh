				<h3 class="title">Confidence is Key</h3>
				<p>I apologise that this post is extremely late, I have had a very exciting few weeks! I’ve landed myself my first big girl job in a primary school which I’m so so so happy about and absolutely loving, so this has taken up most of my time and energy as I’m adjusting to a new routine. Unfortunately, my laptop popped it’s clogs just as I was planning this post, so I have been without a writing tool until now! I hope you can forgive me…
				<br>
				<br>
				Now, those of you who know me well will know that I’m a confident person. Never afraid to speak my mind (despite this not always being the wisest of things…) and always able to do well socially. Some of you might think I’m a bit over confident sometimes, and I probably am… but who’s perfect right?
				<br>
				<br>
				When most people think of confidence they jump to social confidence, the ability to talk to lots of people and to engage in conversation. Being honest, I used to think this too, until I had a bit of an epiphany. I came to this realisation sometime toward the end of my high school education, so around 4 years ago. I remember it like it was yesterday, I came home from a party that I really didn’t enjoy. I remember feeling awkward, out of place and like everyone was staring at me. I remember that I used to feel like this quite a lot, that I used to have to put in so much energy to try and hide the fact that I didn’t know how to fit in with the people around me. Having this constant fear that people didn’t like me. I was looking at myself in the mirror, frustrated as to why I ‘wasn’t my usual self’, why my usual ‘mask’ didn’t work. Thats when I realised, it wasn’t that I was socially unconfident, it was that I was unconfident with who I was.
				<br>
				<br>
				Mind blowing right?!
				<br>
				<br>
				How do you be confident with yourself? How do you look at yourself and say “Yep. I am who I am, and I’m okay with that”. Well my lovely readers, it isn’t easy. Confidence doesn’t come to a person overnight, you can’t buy it in a shop, order it online, find it out on the street. Confidence comes from within. Confidence is a working process. Confidence can be broken, it can be fixed. It can be squandered by anything, but cured by reassurance. So here’s how I found my confidence within myself.
				<br>
				<br>
				Of course, the most integral part of this is acceptance for who you are. I cannot stress this enough. You have to accept everything you are. All your strengths and flaws, all of your imperfections, all of the things you like about yourself, just everything. It’s not just about body acceptance, it’s about the acceptance of your whole self. This means that you have to have a sense of self, which is something that many of us are unsure of. You have to really ask yourself “who am I?”.
				<br>
				<br>
				It sounds like I’m straying away from the topic of confidence, but I promise this will come full circle. So going back to my story, of that fateful night looking at myself in the mirror. What happened next… How have I come to be where I am today? I’ve accepted everything about myself. It’s as simple as that. In order to be confident, you have to be happy with yourself, and that means accepting you for everything you are.
				<br>
				<br>
				Of course it is easier said than done. But this is the key. THIS is the key to confidence. Each and every one of you reading this needs to look in the mirror and say to yourself “I am okay with who I am. I can be confident. I am me”. I know it sounds so corny, and it might not work for everyone, but this is what works for me.
				<br>
				<br>
				Earlier I said that confidence can manifest itself in many different ways in people. Some people might actually be confident in themselves, but really struggle socially. Social confidence is a tricky one, as you cannot solely rely on just yourself, as social situations involve other people. Lets use the example of a new job, as this is one that I’m going through now. It’s daunting because on the first day, you will definitely feel like more of an outsider. Existing staff will already have established friendship groups, you might be unsure of how to do things, and you’ll probably be known as ‘the new girl/guy’. In this context, remind yourself that every single person has had a first day at their first job, so relax. You will survive, and you won’t spontaneously combust if something goes wrong.
				<br>
				<br>
				Now I’ve found this works best in social situations where you might be feeling a little unconfident. Just ask lots of questions. Simple right?! Here’s why this works. Firstly, you probably won’t have to do a lot of talking, so you’ll be able to relax yourself, learn about another person, and build relationships. Secondly, even if you aren’t that confident, it kind of tricks the other person into thinking that you are, because you seem to be engaged and eager. Thirdly, if you keep this up for a few days, you might even get a friend out of it… so don’t give up. Of course, this is a two way street. If you ask questions, you have to be ready to answer some yourself, but don’t be scared! Again, easier said than done but YOU CAN DO IT! I believe you can!
