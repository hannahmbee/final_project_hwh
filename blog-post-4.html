				<h3 class="title">Chronicles of a Curvy Girl: Part 1.</h3>
				<p>
					Before I dive right into this post, I just want to explain the title. I had actually planned to write a fashion/lifestyle/makeup type blog aimed at ladies who might not be the ‘typical’ high street ‘shape’. Now before you all flip your lids about what even is a typical shape, and that size doesn’t matter (which I do agree with so hang on…), I’ve said this because I believe that high street fashion is tailored towards a certain body shape, one that most women don’t have. So I’ve written this it’s more about how to combat high street shopping, how to feel confident in your self, all from my perspective; someone who isn’t the ‘typical’ high street shape.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The chronicles of a curvy girl. I’m so so so excited to start this series, because as I’m sure you’re aware by now, I’m rather opinionated. So where to start. Well I thought I would talk about body confidence, which follows nicely on from last weeks post Confidence Is Key. How do you get body confident? Where does that come from? Does it even exist?
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I would firstly like to say that every person is beautiful. Every person can be confident. Every person has the ability to look at themselves and say “I am okay with what I look like”. I cannot stress how important this is! Being confident about your body is a fluid concept, it changes over time. It’s not something that happens over night.  It’s an ongoing process, with peaks and troughs. This is the second most important thing to understand.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This is such a hard concept to put into words, because everyone the way in which confidence manifests itself in people is different, but I’ll try my hardest to explain what I mean. For a very very long time, I hated my body. I thought what I saw in the mirror was lower than low and that there was nothing physically good about myself. I make the distinction about physical and emotional because they are two very different things! Anyway, it’s only been in the past 2-3 years that I’ve really liked my body and accepted it for what it is.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					One of the biggest aspects attributing towards my acceptance of myself, what learning to stop caring what other people think. Now, if you know me well, you really know that I don’t care what other people think. If I want to wear neon pink eye shadow, I will. If I want to wear clashing colours, I will. Not tooting my own horn, but I really like that about myself, and it’s a skill that I’ve had to learn the hard way.
				</p>
				
				<p>So how do you do it?</p>
				
				<p>
					Lets use an example. You go shopping, find something that you love but there’s that voice in the back of your head saying “Oooh that’s a bit of a risky purchase, are you sure?”. You think “Who cares…” and go for it. You put it on and feel fabulous! Walking down the street, you notice people looking at you, and once you notice one person it seems like every person is. With friends, they don’t compliment you on it. Your confidence in dwindling, spiralling into “Oh God. What have I done? I look so stupid! This definitely makes my hips look big. I can’t believe I did this. I’m so embarrassed.” This is an inner monologue I have experienced many many times. I’ve left the house feeling like the best thing since sliced bread, and I’ve come home feeling like a lump of lard.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Even back when I wore a school uniform, which is the exact same items of clothing 5 days a week… Some days I would feel fabulous and others, well, I struggled to even look in the mirror. This is why I say that body confidence is a fluid concept.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					When I say I’ve had to learn body confidence the hard way, what I mean is that I forced myself to like things that didn’t fit my body shape. I forced myself to wear things that I thought other people liked. I made such an effort to fashionably ‘fit in’ and most of the time I didn’t like what I saw. I used to think that if I lost enough weight my hips would shrink, but that’s just the way that I’m built. It’s taken me a long time to accept that. Part of this is a maturity thing. I mean, really, what 15/16 year old girl is totally and utterly confident in their body?! Anyway, as I matured through uni, I came to realise that really really tight clothes just aren’t my thing. I cant wear super short skin tight dresses with 7 inch heels. I can wear leggings with baggy tops, because that’s what I’m comfortable in. I can wear skinny jeans and a nice shirt, because that’s what I’m comfortable in. I can’t wear really tiny, cleavage showing crop tops because they make me uncomfortable. By wearing the clothes that I like, the confidence I have in myself grows. You will become more comfortable in your own skin allowing you to have confidence.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I know that some of you reading this will be saying to yourself “nothing looks good on me”. I know that feeling, I still get that feeling. But there are good days. They may be few and far between for you, but there are days which aren’t quite as bad as the others. Use those days to explore new styles. Pick something you might not normally go for! See how it makes you feel.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I hope that this empowers some of you out there to look at yourself in the mirror and feel confident in your body. Yes, there are parts of my body that I don’t like. But you know what, I’ve accepted that. I know that there are parts of my body I don’t like, but I don’t let that affect the way that I look at myself. So look at yourself with your chin up, smile, and say to yourself you are beautiful.
