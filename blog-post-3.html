				<h3 class="title">Confessions of a Hopeless Romantic: Part 3.</h3>
				<p>
					The battle of the breakups. It’s not a nice topic to cover but as a hopeless romantic, it is all the more necessary. I admit, there must be something in the water because so many people who are close to me seem to be going through a breakup, or have been through one recently. So I thought this topic most poignant in these ‘troubled’ times.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I’ve found there are two ways to manage a breakup… You either accept it and figure out a way to survive. Or, you fight it… Now I want you to hear me loud and clear. The relationship ended FOR A REASON. Some people may disagree and think “it’s fine, we’ll get back together at some point”. And maybe that’s the case, but I disagree. Your relationship has ended for whatever reason, so is it really wise to re-immerse yourself in that?! I really do apologise if you don’t agree with this, and if you are 
					with someone that you’ve been with in the past and you’re happy, then I’m happy for you too and I’m glad it’s working out! But from my rather long history on the dating battle field, it’s never worked in my favour to get back with someone. And I know that people can change, but I just feel like I need to say that if you’re thinking of getting back with an ex, really think about it and talk it through with friends and people you trust as to whether it’s wise.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now, it is important to note that every breakup is unique to every relationship. Even if two separate relationships ended in the exact same way, the effect of those parties might be completely different. That being said, I think that the nature of the breakup is the most important aspect, as opposed to the individuals involved.
					You could say that breakups lie on a sort of spectrum, where at one end, the ending of the relationship was platonic, and at the other, the breakup was a disaster in itself. If the relationship ended platonically and you both agree that you’re not the best people for each other, then yes, you might be upset and angry and feel immersed in a dark negative spiral. But really, in your heart of hearts, you have to look inside yourself and admit that this breakup is the right thing.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Of course, the messiest, nastiest, most traumatic breakups will take a lot of time and effort to overcome. And here’s how to do it. Firstly remember that you are only human, we all make mistakes, and you aren’t a bad person if you do! Secondly, and this applies to all breakups, it is NOT the end of the world. Your life will go on, it’s what you do that really counts. And thirdly, you have a choice. Do you sit and wallow in your misery; or do you look at yourself, what you need to change, accept this, and start moving forward?
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Moving on manifests itself in many different ways for different people, and all I can give is the way I go about things. For me, I cannot ‘be friends’ with an ex, especially if it was a serious relationship. It’s too weird, maybe that’s a good thing or maybe that’s a bad thing, I just struggle with it. So I have to cut all ties. No talking, no seeing each other. If I’m going to break up with someone, it’s radio silence from me.
					Progressing from a broken relationship is hard, some people champion getting back out there, having a rebound or a quick fling. Others, myself included, see it as an opportunity to focus my inner ‘me’. And this is how I go about moving on. I put in a lot of energy and effort into focusing on myself, ironing out the creases, and gluing myself back together. And as I said earlier, I tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes, the world isn’t going to end, and that I will make the choice to move on from this. It is hard, and it makes me see parts of me that I do not like, but acceptance of who I am always helps me move on. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					As a side note, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don’t go and drink away your feelings. It’s not healthy and it’s just a way to hide from what’s upsetting you, so you might as well confront the issue rather than hiding behind alcohol.
